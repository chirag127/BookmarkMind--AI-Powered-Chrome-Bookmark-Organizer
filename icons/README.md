# BookmarkMind Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

1. Open `../create_simple_icons.html` in a web browser
2. Right-click each canvas and "Save image as..." to save the PNG files
3. Save them in this folder with the correct names

## Icon Design

The icons feature a blue bookmark-style design with:
- Google Blue (#1a73e8) background
- White text lines to represent bookmark content
- Subtle fold effect in the top-right corner
- Clean, minimal design that works at all sizes

## Temporary Solution

If you need to test the extension immediately, Chrome will use a default icon if these files are missing. The extension will work perfectly without custom icons.
