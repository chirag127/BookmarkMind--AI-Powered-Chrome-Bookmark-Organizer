## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load
**Problem**: Extension doesn't appear after loading
**Solutions**:
- Refresh the extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`)
- Make sure you selected the correct folder (should contain `manifest.json`)
- Check that Developer mode is enabled
- Try restarting Chrome

### API Key Issues
**Problem**: "Invalid API key" error
**Solutions**:
- Double-check you copied the complete key from Google AI Studio
- Ensure the key starts with `AIza`
- Try generating a new key
- Check your Google account has API access enabled

### No Bookmarks to Sort
**Problem**: Extension shows "0 uncategorized bookmarks"
**Solutions**:
- Add some bookmarks to your Bookmarks Bar
- Move existing bookmarks out of folders to the Bookmarks Bar
- The extension only processes bookmarks directly in the Bookmarks Bar

### Slow Performance
**Problem**: Sorting takes a very long time
**Solutions**:
- Reduce batch size in Advanced Settings (try 25 instead of 50)
- Check your internet connection
- Large collections (500+ bookmarks) naturally take longer
- Consider organizing in smaller batches

### Permission Errors
**Problem**: Extension can't access bookmarks
**Solutions**:
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
- Check that bookmark permissions are granted
- Try removing and re-adding the extension

## üîÑ Updating the Extension

### For Unpacked Extensions
1. Download the latest version from GitHub
2. Replace the old folder with the new one
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Click the refresh icon (üîÑ) on the BookmarkMind extension
5. Your settings and API key will be preserved
